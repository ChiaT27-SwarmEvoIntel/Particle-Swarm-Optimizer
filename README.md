# Particle-Swarm-Optimization
PSO is a populations based heuristic search method useful for solving optimization problems. In this repository, I will be uploading variants of PSO i happen to code from research papers. To Understand how particle swarm optimization works, there is a notebook with visualization of particle movement. the visalization can help with understanding not only particle movement but also the effects of inertia weight and acceleration coefficients on swarm behavior. Stay tune...
* In this repository, you can find the folowing:
1. Visualization of Particle Movement
2. Implementations of Other PSO variants (mainly from research papers)
3. Benchmark functions for testing algorithm. Stay tune...
